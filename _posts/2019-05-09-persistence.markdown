I've been at this far longer than I had hoped. And while I've had to step away for a few weeks here and there due to work and my personal life I never really thought about giving up or making my final project easier to just get it over with. I had an itch that I needed to scratch and I knew I wouldn't be satisfied until I finished what I set out to do. I don't imagine too many future employers will give me credit for taking months longer to complete something but JWT's and authentication were way harder than an anticipated to wrap my head around. Authentication isn't even required for the final project but I knew I'd need it if I ever wanted to deploy it to the real world. All I wanted was an app that I could use to track my car maintenance and hopefully some of my friends would also use it, I'm getting pretty close to reaching that goal. I still can't believe there isn't an off the shelf solution for this but I guess it makes sense because it's an app that isn't made to be used very often and if users don't have their face in front of the screen then it's hard to sell ads. So there's a zero percent chance I'll make facebook money off of it but at least it won't ruin democracy and that counts for something.
