I liked the sinatra project and really felt like I took the next big step on my journey to becoming a web dev. There was a lot of challenges but I think the biggest thing that tripped me up was the object relationships. It's just one of those things that you can't copy and paste, you gotta know what your doing or you'll never get your app to work right, and I know that because it took me a long time to get my app working correctly. From the labs I looked at the relationships as something you planned out and implemented at the beginning, and this is true, but it's also a living thing that sometimes needs to change and adapt with what you're trying to accomplish in your program. From here on out I'm going to take Avi's advice and draw out the relationships (in something like gliffy) so that I have a visual representation, I really can't 'see the matrix' without it, that way if I need to change something down the road or if something doesn't quite make sense I can just reference the drawing instead of trying to tie the relationships together in my head.
