I just finished up with my Rails project and I'm starting to feel like an actual programmer, not just someone who's done a ton of coding tutorials. I feel like I have a good grasp on Ruby and it's crazy how much I can produce with a little bit of Rails. Now of course this doesn't mean that my journey is over or even coming to an end, there is still more that I don't know than I do know, but I now have a path forward to inverse that relationship. The biggest weakness I see right now in myself has to do with testing. All of the tests are provided, and although I can read them just fine, I know I would struggle if I had to write even a simple test. Hopefully this gets covered more down the line but if not I know I'm going to have to dig in some books.
