As expected I learned an immense amount while working on this project. One of the  things that really held up my progress was implementing JWT's as part of my authentication/verification process, I just couldn't get my head around how they work but like many things in hind sight it all seems so simple. The real kicker with the JWT's is that having a sign in isn't even one of the project requirements. But I knew I was building something that I actually planned on using and would talk at least a few of my friends into using so I had to have it. I could've glossed over it but then I'd be trying to figure it out now and how to retrofit it into my project. The hardest thing about using JWT's is that there isn't just one, or even a dozen,  different ways to use them. It's seemingly endless with variations between different versions of Rails and React.
I'm proud of what I built and I think it looks pretty good (thanks material-ui). There's obviously a bunch of room for improvement since this is my first fullstack project but it's a tool that solves a problem I've been trying to fix for a while and I'm hoping some other people will also find it useful. I've got some minor things to clean up but after that I'm looking forward to figuring out how to deploy it.
